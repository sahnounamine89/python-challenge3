#Pybank

I started by defining the path to my input file and initializing my variables values. Next, i proceeded to open the file and count the votes in the table cand stock the candidate names as by using a test (testing if a candidate name existed, if not then it would be added to the candidate dictionary), the first line of the table is not taken into account. 

Next I designated a file in which to place the analysis results, which were the election results and total votes. I then used a simple for loop to determine the percentage of votes and total votes for each candidate and used an if loop to determine the winning candidate(whoever had the most votes). The results were then displayed. 



#Pypol
I started similar here as in #Pybank, by defining the path to my CSV file and initializing my variables. 

After opening the CSV file, I went through each row in the file with a for loop and calculated the total months and net profit loss. Next I calculated the in profit and losses and updarted the previous profile. Next, omitting the first month's data I used an if loop to go through the data to detmine the greatest increase and decrease by testing a valvue againt the change value. Finally a simple mathematic command to determine the average change in profit/loses. All of the data from the financial analysis was then printed to the terminal.
